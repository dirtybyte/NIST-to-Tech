# NIST-to-Tech

An open-source listing of cybersecurity technologies mapped to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Recognizing that the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable function of critical infrastructure, an [Executive Order in 2013](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity) instructed the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) to create a [cybersecurity framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework) for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

The framework focuses on using business drivers to guide  cybersecurity activities. It considers cybersecurity risks as part of  the organizationâ€™s risk management processes.

## Why the NIST CSF

Itâ€™s a helpful way to relate cybersecurity tools to the NIST CSF capabilities.

NIST isnâ€™t applicable to everyone, but itâ€™s a common way to speak and  maps well to other frameworks. It helped me on a few projects, and I hadnâ€™t seen anything like this before in the wild, so I thought  others would find it valuable too.

## The Technology

What's not included in the framework is  a guide on how to apply technology. There are so many technologies and open-source tools available to achieve the goals of the  framework.

Organizations are all complex in different ways. Technology and it's  implementation requires nuance and results can often vary. 

There is no  one-size-fits-all or truisms when it comes to technology, other than the  fact that every organization needs technology and needs ways to secure  their business.

This repository is a starting point to help the community make technology decisions that map to the  NIST CSF. It will give you a framework to see how your current tools measure up and see what you may be missing and need to consider.
